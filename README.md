# Sales forecasting with ML
Ever wanted to predict the future? Here's a thorough workthrough of how to do it. This dataset contains sales revenue data from a quick-serve restaurant chain featuring 14 separate stores. I go step by step from data cleaning to model evaluation. Rolling window CV, vizualization, feature importance analysis, and other steps also included.

### Information: 
Contains: 
* Slides explaining the model
* Complete workbook
* (TODO) Quick workbook

### Data:
The column descriptions are:
1. Store_ID
2. Fiscal_Quarter
3. DateString in YYYYMMDD format
4. DayOfWeek (1 = Monday)
5. Daypart
6. Hourly weather summary
7. Hour of the day
8. Avg Hourly Temperature during this hour at this store
9. Sales Revenue during this hour (target)

The dataset is rather large, please DM me if you would like access.
